## Libraries to work with REDUX and REDUX-SAGA

Yarn command to install all libraries at once:

```bash
  yarn add redux redux-saga react-redux reactotron-redux reactotron-redux-saga immer
```

- `redux-saga`, `react-redux`: Saga is a more complex version of redux, where you can use middewares on redux actions.

- `reactotron-redux`, `reactotron-redux-saga`: Reactotron libs to work with both redux and redux-saga.

- `immer`: Lib to work with "stage" data. You can create an draft, and then save this draft on immutable Redux variables, like working with common javascript variables.
